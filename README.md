# Finding the Best Pitch to Induce Lower Batting Averages

This project uses **Gradient Boosted Regression**, **Random Forest Regression**, and **Linear Regression** to find the optimal pitch to throw each qualified MLB batter.

This model predicts Expected Batting Average (xBA) _after_ contact.

This model finds pitch parameters to help find the optimal pitch to reduce the chances of a hit given contact.
